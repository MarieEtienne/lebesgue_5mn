## Facts in Stats/ML academic publications

- Multiplication of academic journals and articles <br/>
    *&#8594;	at the expense of quality / scientific accuracy?*
- Lack of valorisation of computer/algorithmic developments and case studies
- Saturation of existing solutions
- Rapid evolution of tools 
  - Great API (`Rstudio`, `VScode`)
  - Scientific Publishing system (`quarto`, `Jupyter`)
  - Integration / dynamics (`git(hub)`, `Actions`)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Computo's Board Positionong
**Need to renew the mode of publication of scientific knowledge and know-how**
::: 

## Existings solutions

### Standard academic journals

*Statistics and Computing, Computational Statistics and Data Analysis, Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, JMLR, JRSS-B, JASA, ...*

::: {.callout-warning}
### Limitations
Fixed format (non-dynamic typically, PDF) limiting reproducibility
:::


### Software journals

*R journal, Journal of Statistical Software, Journal of Open Source Software, JMLR Machine Learning Open Source Software, ROpen-Sci...*

::: {.callout-warning}
### Limitations
Congestion, language-centric, software documentation, not structured around a scientific question
:::

## Computo in a nutshell

::: {.callout-note}
### Aims and Scope
*Promote contributions in statistics and machine learning that provide insight into which models/methods are the most appropriate to a specific question.*
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
### Open and reproducible 
- reproducibility of numerical results is a necessary condition for publication
- all necessary data and code must be available. 
- reviews are open (reviewers can remain anonymous)
:::


::: {.callout-important}
### Assessing reproducibility
**At the submission stage!**

## How does Computo work? (1/2)

### 1. Advanced notebook System

[https://quarto.org](https://quarto.org) (embed *Jupyter* and *RMarkdown*)

  - Code (Python/Julia/R)
  - Math ($\LaTeX$)
  - Biblio ($bib\TeX$)
  - Interactivity (HTML widget, CSS) 

### 2. Git repository and services

[github/github-action](https://github.com/features/actions)

  - Continuous Integration (reproducibility script)
  - Projects Management (submission, publication)
  - Issues (reviewing, discussion)

## How does Computo work? (2/2)

### 3. Container service

[binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/)

  - Easy to customize
  - Easy to interface with github

### 4. Reviewing system

[Scholastica](https://app.scholasticahq.com/)

  - Discussion among Editorial board
  - Reviewer Invitation
  - Anonymous exchanges between authors/reviewers 

&#8594; Eventually published (as Issues)

## Author point of view (1/3)

### Step 0: setup a github repository

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Copy [our template repository](https://github.com/computorg/template-computo-quarto) to use it as a starter
:::

### Step 1. write your contribution

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Write your notebook as usual (Same spirit as Jupyter/Rmarkdown).
:::

### Step 2: configure your binder environment

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
file `environment.yml`

```yaml
name: computorbuild
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - jupyter
  - numpy
  - r-base=4.1.1
```
:::

## Author point of view (2/3)

### Step 3: proof reproducibility

A `git push` will trigger build process on github
``` yaml
name: build
on: push
jobs:
  computorticle:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: # [...]
      - name: Installing dependencies with Miniconda
        uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v2
          environment-file: environment.yml
        # [...]
      - name: Rendering with Quarto
        run: quarto render content.qmd
        # [...]
      - name: Deploying article on github pages
        # [...]
```        

## Author point of view (3/3)

### Step 4. submit

If the build process is successful,

  - An HTML version is pushed on a github-page
  - A PDF version can be obtained via `chrome-print`
  - a `binder` repos can be associated

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
&#8594; Submit the PDF on Scholastica page

## Editor point of view

Once the reviewing process has ended (successfully!)

- Copy the author's repository
- Format to the final version
- Publish reviews as issues
- Add entry on the Journal web site referring
  - github repository
  - data repository
  - reviewing

## Some inspiring initiatives

### Distill

<https://distill.pub>, a journal essentially in Machine/Deep-learning 

### ReScience

<https://rescience.github.io/>, a journal publishing "Remake/Redo" of existing works to prove reproducibility

### Peer Community-In (aka PCI) 

<https://peercommunityin.org/>, a Free recommendation process of scientific preprints based on peer reviews

- Work with communities of *recommenders*
- We plan to create a PCI for Computo to bypass Scholastica
